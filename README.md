# toytools -- A collection of functions to handle toyzero dataset

`toytools` provides a number of handy functions, pytorch Datasets and scripts
to work with data produced by the `toyzero` package.

# Installation
`toytools` is intended for developers, so the best way to install it is to run
```
python setup.py develop
```

## Requirements
The `toytools` package has two mandatory dependencies: `numpy` and `pandas`.
If you would like to use pytorch Datasets, then you would need `pytorch`
installed. Some scripts also depend on `tqdm` to display pretty progress bars.


# Overview
The contents of the `toytools` package can be logically separated into several
categories:
* PyTorch Datasets
* Generic Functions
* Scripts

Below you will find a brief overview of each.


## PyTorch Datasets
At this moment only two PyTorch Datasets are implemented:


### SimpleToyzeroDataset
This is very simplistic datasets object that loads `toyzero` images on demand.
It supports cropping images, filtering images based on the wire plane,
automatically separates dataset into training and validation parts.

If image cropping is required, this dataset tries its best to select only
regions of the image that contain signal. It retries random cropping up to 100
times to find signal regions of the image. However, some `toyzero` images are
completely empty, so this approach fails for such images.


### PreSimpleToyzeroDataset
This is another simplistic dataset object that loads `toyzero` images according
to a preprocessed list, obtained with the `scripts/preprocess` script.
Usage of the preprocessed list of images significantly speeds up image loading
times, since there is no need to perform expensive search of signal regions
in the image. Preprocessing also removes completely empty images from the
dataset.

Similar to `SimpleToyzeroDataset`, `PreSimpleToyzeroDataset` automatically
separates the preprocessed dataset into training and validation parts.


### NOTE
All datasets described in this section are implemented in a `pytorch`
independent way. This allows datasets reuse with other frameworks.

You can use `get_toyzero_dataset` to select a `pytorch`-independent dataset
based on its name.  The `get_toyzero_dataset_torch` will select a
`pytorch`-dependent dataset.


## Generic Functions

`toytools` comes with a variety of functions to handle `toyzero` data:

* `toytools.collect` -- contains functions to search for images in the toyzero
  image directory, parse image names, perform filtering based on image APA
  or wire plane, and load the images themselves.

* `toytools.transform` -- contains functions to determine background value
  of the image, determine whether given image is empty, crop images, and
  search for regions of image that contain signal.

* `toytools.plot` -- a few functions to simplify plotting of the `toyzero`
  images.

## Scripts

You can find two scripts in the `scripts` directory:
1. `preprocess`
2. `view_dataset`

### preprocess

This script can be used to preprocess images of the toyzero dataset.
Preprocessing includes determining the background value of the image
and selection of randomly cropped regions of the image, that contain signal.
Filtering images based on APA and Wire Plane is also supported.

The results of preprocessing are saved in a `csv` file, suitable to be used
with the `PreSimpleToyzeroDataset` dataset.

The preprocessing is a rather slow procedure, so `preprocess` script relies on
a high degree of process based parallelism.

### view_dataset
This script can be used to plot images generated by various datasets
(e.g. `SimpleToyzeroDataset` or `PreSimpleToyzeroDataset`). The images can
be either viewed in an interactive mode (default), or saved to files in a batch
mode (when the ```--plotdir``` argument is specified).
